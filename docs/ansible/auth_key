module: authorized_key
short_description: Adds or removes an SSH authorized key
description:
    - "Adds or removes SSH authorized keys for particular user accounts"
version_added: "0.5"
options:
  user:
    description:
      - The username on the remote host whose authorized_keys file will be modified
    required: true
  key:
    description:
      - The SSH public key(s), as a string or (since 1.9) url (https://github.com/username.keys)
    required: true
  path:
    description:
      - Alternate path to the authorized_keys file
    default: "(homedir)+/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    version_added: "1.2"
  manage_dir:
    description:
      - Whether this module should manage the directory of the authorized key file.  If
        set, the module will create the directory, as well as set the owner and permissions
        of an existing directory. Be sure to
        set C(manage_dir=no) if you are using an alternate directory for
        authorized_keys, as set with C(path), since you could lock yourself out of
        SSH access. See the example below.
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
    version_added: "1.2"
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the given key (with the given key_options) should or should not be in the file
    choices: [ "present", "absent" ]
    default: "present"
  key_options:
    description:
      - A string of ssh key options to be prepended to the key in the authorized_keys file
    version_added: "1.4"
  exclusive:
    description:
      - Whether to remove all other non-specified keys from the authorized_keys file. Multiple keys
        can be specified in a single C(key) string value by separating them by newlines.
      - This option is not loop aware, so if you use C(with_) , it will be exclusive per iteration
        of the loop, if you want multiple keys in the file you need to pass them all to C(key) in a
        single batch as mentioned above.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
    version_added: "1.9"
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - This only applies if using a https url as the source of the keys. If set to C(no), the SSL certificates will not be validated.
      - This should only set to C(no) used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates as it avoids verifying the source site.
      - Prior to 2.1 the code worked as if this was set to C(yes).
    type: bool
    default: 'yes'
    version_added: "2.1"
  comment:
    description:
      - Change the comment on the public key. Rewriting the comment is useful in
        cases such as fetching it from GitHub or GitLab.
      - If no comment is specified, the existing comment will be kept.
